So... long time no update. I've decided to get back into blogging again because @samthor and I are making a new company [Gumnut](https://gumnut.dev)

We're a B2B SaaS building productivity/collaboration/auditing software. I won't focus on how we got here, only really interested in looking forward. But here I'll share some things along the way of what it's like to create a company with 2 young kids. 

I mean, that's it really. I don't know what I'm doing to be honest. I've been reading a ton of stuff beforehand, but I think I want to post about what we *do* instead of what I've *read*. 

I'm super excited to head on this journey, and working with a friend to build something cool and have it work around family is the dream, right? I mean... if we make an income I guess it's the dream ðŸ˜‚

Stay tuned!
