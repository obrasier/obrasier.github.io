Hi, I'm Owen. I'm an educator and engineer on Earth. 

I decided to create a blog to help with a couple of problems I have. I constantly forget how to do things, and having to re-do the same things over and over. So by documenting the process I can hopefully remember better.

Also, I am bad a writing. Specifically, the words I type and the words I think I'm typing are quite often disconnected. By typing more, and making it public, hopefully I can learn to pay more attention to it.

You'll notice all these reasons are perosnal reasons. This blog is about the things and spaghetti code involved in getting a thing to work. Hopefully you'll find some of it helpful. If not... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
